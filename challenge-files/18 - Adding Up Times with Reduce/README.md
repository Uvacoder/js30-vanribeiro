## About JavaScript

Today I learned a little bit more about how to use `reduce()` and `map()` together to some the sum of all time video.

Sorry, I'm not writting more here. I'm little busy on this days.

## Conclusion

Like others class I had here, really useful lesson! 😊💖

You can see final result [here](https://vanribeiro-30daysofjavascript.netlify.app/challenge-files/18%20-%20adding%20up%20times%20with%20reduce/). 😃😉😍

That's all folks! 😃
