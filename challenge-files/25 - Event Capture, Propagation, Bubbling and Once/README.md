**Date:** 05/31/2020

![Event Capture, Propagation, Bubbling and Once](./../../images/challenges/25-event-capture-propagation-bubbling-and-once.png)

## About JavaScript


**Bubble** - when the event propagates from son element to father element (down to up). The most of the JavaScript events can bubble.

**Capture** - when the event propagates from father element to son element (up to down). By default the `capture` is set with `false`. To see this working is necessary to set it with `true`.

**Propagation** - it's possible to stop propagation using `event.stopPropagation()`.

**Once** - allows to execute the event one time if is set with true. In this case, `capture` needs to be `false`.
